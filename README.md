Repo: https://github.com/DonnieBerryDev/Parallax-Task

Time spent on project:

1. Project setup (Dependencies, SCSS variables, base setup): 1h
2. Styling: 3.5h
3. Functionality: 3.5h
4. Research: 1.5h

Total time: 9.5hrs

List of Dependencies:

1. Axios
2. React-id-swiper / Swiper
3. Classnames
4. PropTypes

What I wish I could have done differently:

1. I wish I could have gotten it more pixel perfect as I usually aim too. Since I was locked in with a time restraint, I tried to balance my time between functionality versus styling, which made a clear impact on the final visual product.

2. Put in more transitions / hover effects / animations. Tying into point 1, I simply didn't have time to get these nice to haves.

Notes about the project:

1. Several CSS blocks are missing. This is because of the communication I had with Andy where he stated he would rather see more focus on functionality than styling. So, I skipped a few purely styling blocks. An example being the arrow section seperator.

2. I felt this project showcased my technical ability very well but not so much my pixel perfect attitude. I would be happy to showcase projects where I had more time to compare pixel perfectness as it's a huge priority for me.

3. I usually use Figma, and I couldn't find a way to export CSS straight from Adobe XD without a pro license so, box-shadows and such won't be accurate which is a shame.
